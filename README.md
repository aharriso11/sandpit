# Andrew's Dorset covid statistics

This is the output of me playing around with the R statistical programming language and the coronavirus data produced on a daily basis by Public Health England and published at https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk.

I'm publishing these interpretations of data already in the public domain purely for my personal interest. They are automatically built and pushed to this website daily at 1615 following the Public Health England data release at 1600. If my computer is offline, or the data is late, the page will not update. If the data is late I will try to update this page when the data is released, but as this is run for my own interest this is best endeavours only.
